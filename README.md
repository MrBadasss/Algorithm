## Introduction to Algorithm

In this section, I explore the basics of algorithms, including their definitions, types, and complexities. This provides a solid foundation for understanding more advanced topics.

## Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Breadth-First Search is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or an arbitrary node of a graph) and explores all the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

## Depth-First Search (DFS)

Depth-First Search is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

## Dijkstra's Algorithm

Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks.

## Bellman-Ford Algorithm

The Bellman-Ford algorithm computes shortest paths from a single source vertex to all of the other vertices in a weighted digraph. It is slower than Dijkstra's algorithm for the same problem, but more versatile, as it is capable of handling graphs in which some of the edge weights are negative numbers.

## Floyd-Warshall Algorithm

The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is an algorithm for finding shortest paths in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights (but with no negative cycles). A single execution of the algorithm will find the lengths of the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices.

## 0-1 Knapsack Problem

The 0-1 Knapsack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization. Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.

## Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is both a mathematical optimization method and a computer programming method. The method was developed by Richard Bellman in the 1950s and has found applications in numerous fields, from aerospace engineering to economics.

## Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)

The longest common subsequence (LCS) problem is the problem of finding the longest subsequence common to all sequences in a set of sequences (often just two sequences).

## Hashing

Hashing is the process of converting an input of any length into a fixed-size string of text using a mathematical function. Hashing is used in many applications, such as hash tables, cryptography, and data indexing.

## Backtracking & Greedy Algorithms

Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to some computational problems, notably constraint satisfaction problems, that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons a candidate ("backtracks") as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.

Greedy algorithms are a simple, intuitive class of algorithms that are used in optimization problems. The algorithm makes the optimal choice at each step as it attempts to find the overall optimal way to solve the entire problem.

## Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)

A Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree is a subset of the edges of a connected, edge-weighted undirected graph that connects all the vertices together, without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.

Happy coding!
